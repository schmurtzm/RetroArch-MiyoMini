# 1.16.0
- 3DS: Update __system_initArgv
- 3DS: Update SquirrelJME 3DS Core information along with icons.
- ANDROID: Prevent the android quick tap mouse click emulation while pressing a button on the on-screen overlay
- AUDIO: Fast-Forward Audio Resampling
- AUDIO: Reinit audio on audio sync toggle
- AUDIO/PULSEAUDIO: Support device list for PulseAudio
- AUDIO/WASAPI: WASAPI Frame Delay fix + cleanups
- AUDIO/WASAPI/MIDI: Frame Delay correction
- ARCHIVE/ZIP: Improve ZIP decompression
This reduces the amount of memory Retroarch needs to extract a ROM file.
It will only need the size of the ROM plus 128KiB to extract the file
from the ZIP. Previously it needed as much as twice that amount if the
compression ratio was not great. This is useful on memory constrained
platforms and has no impact on platforms with plenty of memory.
Handles all cases correctly (with and without MMAP, for cores that
require fullpath or not, small and big ZIP files).
- APPLE: Add default keyboard overlay directory to platform_darwin
- APPLE: Update to MoltenVK 1.2.4
- APPLE: Don't include MoltenVK library in Load Core menu list
- APPLE: Enable AltServer JIT for builds installed by Xcode
- APPLE: The default pthread stack size on Apple is too small for detect_ps2_game, so increase it

- EMSCRIPTEN: Fix Emscripten sleep function/macro
- EMSCRIPTEN/RWEBAUDIO: Fix RWebAudioInit race condition
- EMSCRIPTEN/OPENAL: Make openal default audio driver
- INPUT: Combo hold + 'enable_hotkey' correction. Fixed issue with having menu toggle hold combo in different button than 'enable_hotkey', which caused 'enable_hotkey' to also act as menu toggle if held long enough, and simplified and unified duplicate code in start+select holds to a single function.
- INPUT: input_keyboard_event: Don't check hotkey binds when device is RETRO_DEVICE_POINTER
- INPUT: Add input_keymaps_translate_rk_to_ascii() for correct character input to input_keyboard_event
- INPUT: input_overlay_poll: Delay clearing INPUT_OVERLAY_BLOCKED flag until there is no overlay input (Avoids stray input after osk_toggle)
- INPUT: Send keyboard events for modifiers before other keys (for correct modifier+key input if hitboxes overlap)
- INPUT: Remember currently set keyboard mapping bits during same config read, because otherwise customized keybinds can get cleared out of the bits on the next iteration, causing keyboard events to get passed to the core when they should get blocked.
- INPUT/LINUX/UDEV: Log mouse devices in info level
- INPUT/LINUX/UDEV: First working version of udev driver with touchscreen support and gestures.
- INPUT/WAYLAND: Add wayland to input driver list
- INPUT/MENU: move port X binds into retropad binds submenu and add appropriate help text and sublabels to discourage people from messing around in there unnecessarily
- INPUT/MENU: Add menu icons to 'RetroPad Binds'
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Add overlay parameter to control x/y separation in auto-scale mode
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Revive/rewrite Keyboard Overlay and OSK Toggle. Add keyboard overlay preset, keyboard submenu, 
and osk_toggle hotkey. Use overlay caching for osk_toggle.
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Overlay Caching. Adds overlay_cache_ptr to keep a disabled overlay in memory when it's expected to be shown again.
Most input_overlay_deinit calls are replaced with input_overlay_unload, which caches the overlay unless initing/deiniting core or disabling overlays.
Loading a cached overlay is done as a swap, intended for osk_toggle.
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Add input_overlay_check_mouse_cursor() to preserve show/hide mouse behavior
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Don't apply input_overlay_show_mouse_cursor in windowed mode (controlled by mouse grab only)

- TVOS: tvOS Siri remote handling 
It's not really usable as a game controller, but it is good for going
through the menu as a simple LRUD.
This also adds better support for names of mFI controllers, as well as
being able to do the expected tvOS behavior of "backing out" of the app.
